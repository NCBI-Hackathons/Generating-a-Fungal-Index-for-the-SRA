# Generating a Fungal Index for the SRA

This project will work towards the creation of an index of all fungi in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA).
Fungi are essential to ecosystems, but some species are deadly to plants and animals, including crops and humans. There are many SRA datasets with unrecognized fungi in them; generation of a fungal index for the SRA would help guide researchers to datasets of interest.

See the [hackathon wiki](https://github.com/NCBI-Hackathons/Generating-a-Fungal-Index-for-the-SRA/wiki) for further details.
